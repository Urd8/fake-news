# fake-news

Student Project for a STI

Throughout this project, we have created a fake news detector prototype. With the capability of identifying and debunking news that was spreaded falsely. Our main purpose of creating such a prototype, is to prevent the chaos and disruption caused by the spread of false news, especially false facts which are written to promote a political agenda or a set of ideas.

Our systems provides functions such as:

A search module in which list out local and credible new sources articles according to what user wishes to search.

A web scraping function which acts as a filter that scrapes only the paragraph element of a webpage. 

A grading function which calculates the percentage match from userâ€™s input with an article.

An AI Credibility function is using AI to grade the article title and content.

Output function that displays all the relevant data after running through all modules

A google chrome extension that uses an AI to filter fake news.

Lastly, a feedback form where users can provide useful critiques that help to further better our services.
